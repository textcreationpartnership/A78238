         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the Church-Wardens and Veſtry of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> in <hi>Southwark.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Wardens of the Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> now known by the Name of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> were, by Letters Patents 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. made a Body Corporate, and confirmed by Act of Parliament 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>The Monaſtery of St. <hi>Mary Overy</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> being ſoon after diſſolved, the Pariſhioners of St. <hi>Margaret</hi> and St. <hi>Mary Magdalen Overy</hi> were by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. United, and made into one Pariſh, called by the Name of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and the Church-Wardens thereof were then made a Perpetual and Able Body Corporate.</p>
            <p>Which ſaid Pariſh of St. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, <hi>Anno</hi> 1556. upon a General Meeting, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conſent of the then Inhabitants, there was, for the better Rule, Profit and Quiet of the ſaid Pariſh, a Select Veſtry of Thirty Perſons choſen, which were to have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion by the Survivors Election of others in the ſtead of any dying or departing the Pariſh, and had the Choice of ſucceeding Church-Wardens, and together with them the Government of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>By which Veſtry the ſaid Pariſh was well and peaceably governed for above Eighty Years, until the late unhappy Wars, when in the General Calamity of Government the ſame was broken and diſcontinued, and then the Government and Managery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Affairs being various, great Diſcords and Inconveniences aroſe among the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, to the great Prejudice of the Pariſh; for appeaſing whereof, and Prevention of Tumults and Routs upon Elections in a Pariſh ſo large, the Church-Wardens and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners Petitioned King <hi>Charles</hi> II. (of Bleſſed Memory) to be freed from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, and reduced to their ſo Ancient Government of Thirty Men.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> in Council was graciouſly pleaſed to refer the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>George</hi> then Duke of <hi>Albemarl,</hi> and the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> and whom they ſhould nominate, which were the then Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord-Chancellor, and the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who being all preſent together, upon the Humble Addreſs of the then Church-Wardens and Inhabitants, and full Hearing of the whole Matter, granted Leave to the Church-Wardens to convene the Inhabitants in their Pariſh-Church for the chooſing of ſuch Veſtry of Thirty Men, which by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the then Church-Wardens, <hi>(viz.) Die Dominico</hi> 14 <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1664. was done, and Twenty-four added to the Six Church-Wardens then in being, which made the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Thirty Perſons, who by ſucceſſive Elections have ever ſince fairly managed the Affairs of the Pariſh, and now do, to the great Satisfaction of the greater Part of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The Church Wardens of St. <hi>Saviour's,</hi> in the Name of <hi>John Bingham</hi> and others, for a conſiderable Sum of Money, did purchaſe in free Soccage of King <hi>James</hi> I. by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, in the Ninth Year of his Reign, the Rectory and Pariſh-Church of St. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s aforeſaid, and all Glebe-Land, Tithes, Tenths, Oblations, Profits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what elſe did then belong to the Rector-Church of St. <hi>Margaret</hi> and St. <hi>Mary Magdalen Overy,</hi> or to the ſaid Rectory and Church of St. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, being formerly Part of the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid late diſſolved Priory, and are thereby obliged to keep a fit Houſe for a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar School for teaching the Children of the ſaid Pariſh, and to provide a ſufficient Maſter to teach them, and to pay him 20 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and 10 <hi>l.</hi> Yearly to an Uſher, and alſo Two Able Chaplains to Preach in their ſaid Church, and to pay them 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> each, which was accordingly done till 1672. and then the Sallaries of the ſaid Chaplains was by Act of Parliament advanced to an 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> a-piece, and the School-Maſters to 30 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which has been duely paid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That by the Acts of Parliament 24 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the Church Wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to Raiſe upon the Inhabitants, in Lieu of Tithes, any Sum not exceeding 350 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> beſides Charges of Collecting.</p>
